					<span class="header">ABOUT</span>
					<p>
						I'm a full-time student at the University of South Florida 
						pursuing a BS in Computer Science. 
						I've achieved a 4.0 into my third year.
					</p>
					<p> 
						Two years before attending USF, I picked up as many books as I
						 could manage and taught myself to code.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've always been drawn to video games as they are the crossroads of multiple art forms 
						like story, music, sound, animation, and visual art. Games allow us to slay dragons,
						dog-fight in space, and challenge our minds with complex puzzles. They tell stories
						of life and death, mistakes, love, and friendship.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of class, I have invested my free time creating games and other software, 
						some of which I have included here. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I hope you enjoy!
 					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>
						My skills include:
					</p>
					<p>
						C <br />C# <br />C++<br />html<br />CSS
					</p>
					<p>
						Photoshop<br />Unity<br />Blender
					</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						I am interested in software and game development internships this coming Summer 
						2017 and will enter the job market after graduation in May 2018.
					</p>

						Please contact me at <strong>groffjoel@gmail.com</strong> 
						if you would like to learn more about my 
						experience or how I could help your organization with its next project.
