					<span class="header">A* Pathfinding Through Procedurally Generated Levels</span>
					<p> <strong>GOAL</strong>
						<br /> Build a procedurally generated dungeon and have enemies navigate with A* pathfinding.
					</p>
					<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
						<br /> I built this project in order to test basic A* pathfinding with the Manhattan distance method. Secondly,
						the project demonstrates a procedural level system in which rooms and hallways are generated based on user defined input.
						The movement is all cell based, meaning the player can move up/down/left/right in single cell steps.
					</p>
					<p>
						Enemies only move when the player moves or if the player is in their line of sight.
						The player can shoot the skeletons or the barrels to clear new paths.
					</p>
					<p>
						The level generation works sequentially by creating a randomly sized room, placing the room inside a limited grid, then
						connecting a hallway in a random direction. The next room is then attached to the end of the previous hallway. Rooms and
						halls can overlap, creating a more complex map. The grid-system uses a 2D array of ints to store cell information.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once rooms and hallways have assigned their values, the array is scanned to detect where walls should be placed.
						After the map is built, enemies,treasure, barrels, and the player are randomly placed.
						The level system is heavily based on the Unity procedural tutorials.
					</p>
					<p>
					 	Pathfinding is based on the Manhattan distance method, in which enemies evalaute the shortest distance to the player based on
						up/down/left/right cell adjacency. Each step, the algorithm picks the cell with the lowest movement cost and lowest distance from
						the destination, updating the movement distance of the cells adjacent to the most recently picked cell. I have included a sample
						of the code, found on the right.
					</p>

						<br />C#
