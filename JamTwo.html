				<strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
				<br />I created Wizard102 during the USF Game Dev Club 2017 game jam. It is
				designed to be a mobile game, where players swipe their finger to move as well
				as destroy enemies.

				<p>
				Because I only had 6 hours to complete the game, I decided
				to make each level procudurally generated, with a random number of white squares
				and enemies spawning in random locations. The game also increases its difficulty,
				spawning more enemies after each wave. Originally the game had horrible,
				medieval-themed pixel art, a ninja that mercilessly smote wizards. After the jam,
				I swithced this art with simple polygons. I did not have time to add sound.
				</p>
				<p>
				Why is called Wizard102 you may ask?

				<strong>TOOLS</strong>
				<br />Unity
				<br />Photoshop
				<br />C#
